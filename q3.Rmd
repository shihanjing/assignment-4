title: "Question 3"
---

First we prepare some files to work with.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
dir.create("files", showWarnings = FALSE)
set.seed(141)
1:100 %>% walk(function(i) {
    dt <- tibble(x = rnorm(5000), y = rnorm(5000))
    write_csv(dt, file.path("files", sprintf("file%02d.csv", i)))
})
```

In this question, we are going to familiarize ourself with the `parallel` package.

In the folder `files`, there are some text files and each file contains 5000 rows of numbers. The files names are
```{r}
file_names <- file.path("files", list.files("files"))
```


##### (a) Determine the correlation between `x` and `y` in each file using a single core.


##### (b) Use `parLapply` to determine the correlation between `x` and `y` in each file.



##### (c) Use `parLapplyLB` to determine the correlation between `x` and `y` in each file.



##### (d) Benchmark part (a) to part (c). Comment on the speeds.
